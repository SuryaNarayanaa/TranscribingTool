WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:04.742
Right. I actually promised my friends that I'd make this video quite a while ago,

00:04.798 --> 00:07.670
but I've not got around to it. But now I finally got around to it.

00:07.702 --> 00:11.502
So here it is in this video. I'm just going to be attempting to

00:11.558 --> 00:15.246
do a variety of accents from around

00:15.350 --> 00:18.790
the world. I'll start off with accents from my own country, which has

00:18.822 --> 00:22.062
lots of different accents. I'm from Britain in

00:22.078 --> 00:25.414
case you didn't notice. I'm from the UK and yeah, there's lots of different british

00:25.454 --> 00:28.824
accents can do. And then I'll move on to accents

00:28.904 --> 00:32.152
from other countries. And that the

00:32.168 --> 00:36.376
way I'm going to structure this video is for each accent I'm going to pretend

00:36.400 --> 00:39.272
I'm on the phone and I'm going to chat a random stuff. And when I

00:39.288 --> 00:42.992
say random, I mean 100% random. It is completely not a

00:43.008 --> 00:46.472
rubbish. Don't pay attention to what I say, don't take it seriously.

00:46.568 --> 00:50.152
It's just random chatter in the accent. I may

00:50.168 --> 00:54.144
have made a few references here and there to the individual

00:54.184 --> 00:57.672
accent, but it's mostly random. But yeah, that's how I'm gonna structure it.

00:57.688 --> 01:01.040
So let's begin. Alright, it's Dave

01:01.072 --> 01:04.704
there. You right, mate? How's it going, son? Yeah, I'm fine,

01:04.744 --> 01:08.256
mate. Just doing a bit of diY. This place is a fucking shithole,

01:08.360 --> 01:12.320
but I'll have it sorted in no time. Wah gwangla. What? You seen?

01:12.472 --> 01:15.724
Nah, school, fam. What? Ebla. What are you talking about?

01:16.024 --> 01:19.262
Ebla. Don't fucking hang up on me. What the fuck?

01:19.448 --> 01:22.402
Pusill, what the fuck are you looking at?

01:22.458 --> 01:26.410
Great, great, fantastic. Thanks a lot. Oh,

01:26.442 --> 01:30.002
and don't forget to bring the briefing documents and insurance papers.

01:30.058 --> 01:33.586
Yes, great, thank you. I mean, if you ask me,

01:33.730 --> 01:37.122
there are a great number of individuals on that list who I most

01:37.178 --> 01:40.418
deeply despise. One of them has been

01:40.506 --> 01:44.014
my family's arch rival since the mid 18th century.

01:44.434 --> 01:48.086
Yes, I woke up this morning to see some bastard who stole my

01:48.110 --> 01:51.462
chatter. Anyway, are you coming with me later to

01:51.478 --> 01:55.182
see Plymouth Rogue? Nice green horn,

01:55.238 --> 01:58.854
mate. The guy that was interviewing me was a fucking

01:58.894 --> 02:02.222
knobhead. Nope, seriously, like, he asked me if I

02:02.238 --> 02:05.830
was irish or scottish. I mean, just cause I don't sound like one of them

02:05.862 --> 02:09.502
fucking southern fairies I like. Mate, how's it

02:09.518 --> 02:12.876
going? I'm fine. Well, yesterday I got in the

02:12.900 --> 02:16.556
fucking bar braille cause I was this cheeky dickhead. It was like, give me

02:16.580 --> 02:19.764
funny looks and that. So I fuckin smashed a bottle over his head

02:19.884 --> 02:23.412
and then like three of his maids fuckin grab me from behind. But then

02:23.428 --> 02:26.500
I, like, fart them off like I was, like, swatting like flies.

02:26.572 --> 02:30.660
It was bloody fantastic. Aliens and Cardiff?

02:30.852 --> 02:34.884
I don't think so. Listen, I think you need professional

02:34.964 --> 02:38.076
help. I have a phone number here for

02:38.100 --> 02:41.308
a high quality cancelling service. Did you just call me a

02:41.316 --> 02:45.424
shipshagger? That is not acceptable. You bloody bastard.

02:46.084 --> 02:49.692
A baseball bat, an oozy and

02:49.748 --> 02:53.740
a petrol bomb. And then he fucking dropped to the floor unconscious.

02:53.932 --> 02:57.532
Unconscious. Can you believe that? And I

02:57.548 --> 03:01.092
just sat there thinking, is it me or is he just a

03:01.108 --> 03:04.140
wee bit off his head? If you give him an inch, he'll take a fucking

03:04.172 --> 03:08.144
mail. You have got a decision to make. I'll count down.

03:08.304 --> 03:12.004
54321.

03:12.344 --> 03:15.656
Time's up. Get the fuck out, simple ass. I'm not just

03:15.680 --> 03:19.324
going to stand by and watch some paunch little fucker put me out of business.

03:19.624 --> 03:22.392
I will burn his fucking place down to the ground if I have to.

03:22.488 --> 03:25.728
And I will stay there for the fire show with a pint of Guinness

03:25.816 --> 03:29.448
in one hand and a pint of Magnus in the other, safe in the knowledge

03:29.496 --> 03:32.272
that that cunt won't be fucking with me ever, ever again.

03:32.408 --> 03:36.088
Dude, I'm not an asshole. I don't like talking to people

03:36.136 --> 03:39.352
like that. But that bitch had it coming. Seriously, at the

03:39.368 --> 03:42.824
end of the day, some people just take the piss. I was really

03:42.864 --> 03:46.288
good to her and she treated me like a fucking doormat. And that is not

03:46.336 --> 03:46.964
cool.

03:48.864 --> 03:51.744
Anyway, I gotta go. I'll see you later.

03:51.784 --> 03:55.792
Dude, that douchebag killed his fucking dog.

03:55.968 --> 03:59.080
That's just crossing the line. I mean, it was real close to that dog,

03:59.112 --> 04:02.928
you know? I just think this whole situation's got out of control

04:03.096 --> 04:06.840
and I don't know what to do. Boss, any advice? I can't

04:06.872 --> 04:10.536
understand a goddamn word you're saying, you stupid retard.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.544
I ain't gonna sit here trying to figure out what kind of mumbo jumbo,

04:14.584 --> 04:18.284
jibber jabber bullshit's coming out of your stupid chicken shit mouth.

04:18.784 --> 04:22.256
Marianne. Marianne, give me another beer. I make

04:22.280 --> 04:24.822
sure it's cold this time, bitch. Right.

04:24.958 --> 04:28.142
Okay. Yes, yes, it's the building

04:28.198 --> 04:32.158
by the fish market. Well, since your last visit, we've got the shower

04:32.206 --> 04:35.566
working and, well, Bill's always on his way down. Open the

04:35.590 --> 04:39.154
back gate. So the only question is,

04:39.614 --> 04:43.470
where the bloody hell are you? What a fucking joke.

04:43.662 --> 04:46.462
Bonjour. Oh, sorry,

04:46.518 --> 04:50.038
sorry. Yes, I do speak English. So you want me to pass

04:50.086 --> 04:53.004
this message on to him now? No.

04:53.344 --> 04:57.136
Okay, well, I will notify him that you are trying to contact him.

04:57.240 --> 05:00.816
Okay, thanks very much. Bye bye. Trying to

05:00.840 --> 05:04.368
figure out the button layout. But if you see Heinrich,

05:04.496 --> 05:08.104
just remember to pass on this message to him that he is

05:08.144 --> 05:10.444
a fucking cheat.

05:10.904 --> 05:13.904
That's all. Thank you, Yuri.

05:14.024 --> 05:17.720
Hello? It's Nikola here. I will never forget that

05:17.752 --> 05:21.606
time in Moscow when Michael stole Dmitri's vodka.

05:21.710 --> 05:25.046
And then he started singing soviet national anthem.

05:25.110 --> 05:29.390
Remember that time in volo grad when Dmitry stole

05:29.422 --> 05:32.558
the police motorbike and crashed into ice cream parlor?

05:32.686 --> 05:36.182
Well, I tried to tell him before,

05:36.278 --> 05:39.774
but there was a communication issue. There was nothing

05:39.814 --> 05:43.542
I could do. I'm so very sorry that this happened. You need

05:43.558 --> 05:47.298
to go compare yourself. I regretfully inform you

05:47.386 --> 05:49.974
that it is now outside of my responsibility.

05:50.474 --> 05:54.338
I assure you that I told Mister Wong that the business plan was to go

05:54.386 --> 05:58.130
forward. I don't have to keep running around fixing every little mistake

05:58.162 --> 06:00.930
that these stupid, incompetent people make.

06:01.122 --> 06:05.130
I have a fucking business to run here, and I don't need the hassle.

06:05.322 --> 06:08.214
Good day to you. I thought Tokyo was the one.

06:08.594 --> 06:12.326
Meet me at my apartment in Nagasaki tomorrow at 04:00 p.m.

06:12.450 --> 06:15.326
These people think. Cause they say nothing.

06:15.470 --> 06:19.526
They are strong. Well, tomorrow, all behind

06:19.590 --> 06:22.594
this will be shamefully exposed.

06:23.534 --> 06:26.794
Hey. Hey. Don't bloody talk to me like that, you bloody bastard.

06:27.094 --> 06:30.446
I am the one trying to help you here. Who else can help you,

06:30.510 --> 06:33.990
huh? Your uncle? Huh? He can't even tie his bloody shoelace

06:34.022 --> 06:37.286
properly. Without me, you would

06:37.310 --> 06:41.200
not be where you are today. Yeah, right. The dopey little shit couldn't

06:41.232 --> 06:44.608
even do a test job without getting a paper cut. I'm serious,

06:44.656 --> 06:48.352
man. I've practically looked everywhere, and the only place I could find

06:48.448 --> 06:51.816
was this fucking dump here. I know, man. It takes

06:51.840 --> 06:55.104
the fucking piss. But what can you do, huh? Hey, don't worry, don't worry.

06:55.144 --> 06:58.768
I can't change the details. That is not a problem. But this

06:58.816 --> 07:01.800
other guy, he's becoming a pest.

07:01.992 --> 07:05.606
I mean, this guy, man, who does he think he is? This is a

07:05.630 --> 07:08.514
fucking irritating. We don't want it,

07:08.814 --> 07:11.034
right? That's all I can do for now.

07:12.374 --> 07:16.150
Obviously, some were a little bit off. I did

07:16.182 --> 07:20.158
make some mistakes here and there, you know, I'm only human. No one's perfect.

07:20.286 --> 07:23.574
But I did my best. And in

07:23.614 --> 07:27.134
no way meant to offend anyone or insult anyone's accent or culture

07:27.174 --> 07:30.382
or whatever. Even if I did chat random, stupid stuff on the

07:30.398 --> 07:33.404
phone. It's just. Just because I couldn't think of anything to say,

07:33.444 --> 07:36.628
really. But nothing was personal or nothing

07:36.676 --> 07:40.596
like that, you know, I made this mainly for

07:40.620 --> 07:43.828
my friends. Because they seem to be entertained. When I impersonate different

07:43.876 --> 07:47.264
accents. And so I thought I'd make the video and,

07:47.644 --> 07:51.012
you know, if you watching and you like it,

07:51.068 --> 07:54.364
then feel free to comment, like subscribe,

07:54.404 --> 07:58.564
whatever. I don't usually make videos like this, by the way. I usually make video

07:58.724 --> 08:02.028
about games and, and Microsoft's ham text

08:02.076 --> 08:05.380
to speech voices and stuff like that. But just subscribe anyway.

08:05.412 --> 08:09.220
You never know, I might remake this a better version or

08:09.292 --> 08:12.644
something similar to this. But thanks for watching.

08:12.804 --> 08:13.164
Yeah,
